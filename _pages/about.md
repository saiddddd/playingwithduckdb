### Namaste 🙏

Thanks for visiting my humble abode on the Internet. I am Vivek, a freelance Data Scientist :man_technologist: by profession.

***[Saṃsāra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra)*** means *World* in Sanskrit and I welcome you into mine where I blog about programming.

I have over 5 years of broad experience in Python & Machine Learning ecosystems across different sectors ranging from Fashion to Mobility to Fintech. Apart from :snake: :computer: :chart:, I am also interested in :tractor::man_farmer:, :musical_note: and aim to know a little bit of everything I come across.

Please feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivekvaddina) or via [e-mail](mailto:6368653+samsaara@users.noreply.github.com) for any freelancing, consulting or workshop opportunities. 😃
