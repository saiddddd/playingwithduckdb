## Namaste üôè

Thanks for visiting my humble abode on the Internet. I am Vivek, a freelance `Data Scientist` by profession.

**[Sa·πÉsƒÅra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra)** means *World* in Sanskrit and I welcome you into mine where I blog about programming, among other things.

I have over 6 years of experience in Python & Machine Learning ecosystems across a broad range of sectors ranging from Fashion :shopping: to Mobility :kick_scooter: to Fintech :currency_exchange:. At [Sezzle](https://sezzle.eu/), a platform offering BNPL [^1] service, I worked on developing and deploying their early machine learning based fraud detection models. Prior to that at [FreeNow](https://www.free-now.com/de/), a mobility solutions provider, I worked on GMV [^2] forecasting, churn prediction... Apart from :snake: :computer: :bar_chart:, I am also interested in :man_farmer::tractor:, :musical_note: and aim to know a little bit of everything I come across.


Please feel free to reach out to me for any business, consulting or workshop opportunities. üòÉ
