## Namaste 🙏

Thanks for visiting my humble abode on the Internet. I am Vivek, a freelance `Data Scientist` :man_technologist: by profession.

**[Saṃsāra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra)** means *World* in Sanskrit and I welcome you into mine where I blog about programming, among other things.

I have over 5 years of experience in Python & Machine Learning ecosystems across a broad range of sectors ranging from Fashion to Mobility to Fintech. Apart from :snake: :computer: :chart:, I am also interested in :tractor::man_farmer:, :musical_note: and aim to know a little bit of everything I come across.

Please feel free to reach out to me for any freelancing, consulting or workshop opportunities. 😃
